# AppuntiUni

Repository that contains everyhting that i've created during my years in University studying Engineering In Computer Science @ Sapienza
Hope that someone, somewhere, finds it useful!

If the indentation is wrong that is github's fault! Check the raw file (by clickin on the top right on the small "raw" button), and on there you will find the actual file i've uploaded, and that should be formatted correctly
