## Q1. Symmetric ciphers

1. Symmetric ciphers are a way to encrypt data. It's called symmetric since the key used in the algorithm for the encryption process is the same for the decryption. A cipher is asynchronous if the bit encrypted at the iteration i needs the encrypted bit at the i-1th iteration, while in the synchronous case this isn't needed. Stream ciphers are ciphers that don't required a specified lenght for the plaintext, and work with a stream of pseudo-randomical bits (derived from a key) to encrypt. Block ciphers need a specified input size (a block) to work. Modes of operations are a way to encrypt a file that contains multiple block, and these can be both synchronous or asynchronous.
2. RC4, or Ron's Code 4, is a synchronous stream cipher, which is praised for its speed and simplicity. It's based on two different phases. In the key generation, a 256 byte buffer is initialized, from  to 255, and the key is used to do permutations on the buffer. On the encryption process the buffer is used to encrypt the plaintext while continuing to permutate.
3. OFB is blah blah, CTR is blah blah. They are both good, daje! CTR is also parallelizable, especially considering OFB: even better porto io!
