# Ex 1
Leader election is a way in which a set of processes need to agree on who to elect as a leader. It works by knowing the correct processes (by knowing who's faulty). It's impossible to know if a process is truly faulty, so there may be a time where a process is wrongly suspected of a fault, so leader changes to another one and so we temporarily won't have agreement on it.

### b.
In case of a single crash failure we would break validity, since we may loose messages so a broadcast request may never be delivered by all correct processes.
### c.
if we had a crash of a leaf no problem, while in the case of a node in between we may need to create a partition! We also need to clear the buffer of failed processes and update next_ts accordingly (if next_ts == ts_of_failed_process then next_ts++)
