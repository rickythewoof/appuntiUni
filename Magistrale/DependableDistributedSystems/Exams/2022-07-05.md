# Ex 1
(1,N) regular register is a particular specification in which we have a variable that gets written by a single process and N processes can read it. 

### Functions
read / readReturn
write / writeReturn
### Properties
- **Termination**: a read/write request made from a correct process always returns with the corresponding read/writeReturn
- **Integrity**: a read may return the value of the last write or will return the value of the concurrent write
### Majority Voting
In the case in which we assume that a writing process may fail we may indefinitely wait for 
an answer.
# Ex 2
1. Add $m_3, m_4$ to $p_3$
2. Add $m_3, m_4$ to $p_3$, add $m_1$ to $p_1$
3. Add $m_3, m_4$ to $p_3$, add $m_1$ to $p_1, p_2$
4. Since:
	Local: $m_2 \rightarrow m_3$
	FIFO: $m_1 \rightarrow m_3$
	- We need to just add deliveries, not modify
# Ex 3
1. TO(NUA, SNUTO) / TO(NUA, WUTO) -what's the strongest?
2. we need to add $m_2$ and $m_4$ to both $p_2$ and $p_3$, adding them following 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Ex 4
1. Omission failures don't break any property, since Regular Reliable Broadcast has agreement in the correct processes, and the omission failure processe are not. They may simply not retransmit the broadcast, but correct processes will, so correct ones will deliver all or not deliver a message.
2. Regular Reliable Broadcast fails because no Creation proerty is broken, by creating a message spoofing the sender. Other than that the other properties remain untouched
