# Ex 1
### Properties
- **Termination**: if a correct process invokes an operation, then the operation eventually receives the corresponding confirmation;
- **Validity**: a read operation returns the last vale written or the value concurrently written.
### Majority Voting algorithm
Majority voting is the one used when a perfect failure detector cannot be used. Each written value is associated with a timestamp and there is a quorum
# Ex 4
## Properties
- _Validity_: Not satisfied, byzantine may send a fake message with sender $s$ with $lsn$ = next\[s], thus making the next message from $s$ fail to be delivered
- _No duplication_: Not satisfied, byzantine may send two different messages with different _lsn_ s (depends)
- _No creation_: Not satisfied, byzantine can fake sender 
- _Agreement_: Satisfied. Since agreement is directly inherited from $rb$ and $rb$ is not compromised, then Agreement isn't either in $frb$
- _FIFO delivery_: Satisfied.
