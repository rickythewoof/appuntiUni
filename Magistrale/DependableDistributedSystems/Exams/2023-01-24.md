- Perfect Failure Detector needs to address two properties:
	- **Correctness**: If a process gets flagged by the FD as crashed by any process, the process is crashed
	- **Integrity**: If a process crashes then the failure detector will eventually flag it as crashed
- It can be implemented by sending HEARTBEAT packets. Since the system is synchronous, we have an upper bound on the time the process will answer. We can keep track of correct processes by sending them heartbeats. The processes that didn't answer get flagged as crashed.
- If we use fair loss p2p directly we cannot be sure if a process didn't answer because it crashed or the HEARTBEAT/ACK got dropped.

|   T    | Every message $m_i$ broadcast by correct processes are correctly delivered by correct process |
|   F    | the message $m_1$ got delivered by the faulty process, which breaks uniform agreement         |
|   T    | Yes, since regular agreement is valid                                                         |
|   F    | No, we don't have agreement on the correct processes                                          |
|   F    | No, we break agreement over the correct processes                                             |

|   F    | $p_2$ breaks fifo ordering over the messages $m_2$ and $m_3$ broadcast by $p_4$               |
|   T    | All processes that deliver both $m_2$ and $m_3$ do so in the same order                       |
|   F    | We don't have uniform agreement since $p_1$ delivers $m_1$                                    |
|   F    | Order between $p_1$ and $p_4$ is not respected                                                |

We can implement a token-based system. We send the token along a data structure to store the value. On the moment in which someone asks the oracle a get_sum, the oracle creates a unique token (a box in which store its value) and returns when the box gets back to him, triggering a sum_return | sum(box)

**init**
	id = self
	state = idle
	next = get_next(self)
	myVal = get_myVal(self)

**upon event \<O, get_sum\>**
	if state == idle
		val = myVal
		state = waiting
		trigger <pl, Send | \[SUM, val, id], next>

**upon event <pl, Deliver | \[SUM, val, id'], p>**
	if id' == id && state == waiting
		state = idle
		trigger <O, sum_return | val>
	else
		trigger <pl, Send | \[SUM, val+myVal, id], next>

It would be impossible. If everyone is the same there wouldn't be a reliable way to stop the addition, since every request is the same and cannot be distinguished.
