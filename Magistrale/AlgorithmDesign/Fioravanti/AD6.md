Given a universe of elements $U$, and a set of subsets $S$, such that union of the subsets is $U$, and given an integer $k$, find a subsets $R$ of sets in $S$ such that $|R| \le k$ and $\cup_{e_i \in R} e_i = U$.
Our counseors will be the subsets $S$, and the sports the universe of elements in $U$. We can ask ourselves the same question.
