# AD Notes 
These are VERY quick and probably very incomplete nodes, made in 4 days because I needed to completely redo an exam. Please use the other PDF for more updated and complete notes regarding Algorithm Design.
I have also done some of the exercises Fioravanti gave us during lectures, but they may not be fully complete (AD8 never existed).

Thank you, and I hope you find them useful
